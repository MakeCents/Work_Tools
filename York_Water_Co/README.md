York_Water_Co
=============

Information about Oracle position available, app designed in python

A job was available with the York Water Company. A friend applied for the job and then sent me the information. I created an app in Python with Tkinter and put it here incase the job comes up again.

	This tool has been designed specifically for the information found
		in "sample_wo_data.txt." and only reads and displays the data.
	It assumes this tool and the file are in the same folder
	It loads a file, creates objects based on Work Order Number,
		displays those Work Order Numbers in a form, for selection, to show
		the Work Order Details in another form.
	Only one Work Order will show at a time.
	When closing the main form, with Work Order Numbers, the Details form
		will close as well.
